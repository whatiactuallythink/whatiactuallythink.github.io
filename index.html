                Developers delude themselves into thinking they're "changing the world." Most of us
                just push JSON and YAML around.
            </li>
            <li>
                We shouldn't be in such a goddamn hurry all the time. This notion that we don't have to make
                version 1.0 any good because we have to "just get something out there" is crap.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ideas are cheap. The harder someone jealously protects their precious idea behind NDAs, the
                more likely their idea is a pile of garbage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stop with all the personality worship shit, especially on Twitter. Some influencer says
                something, and you all go around saying it like a bunch of parrots. Go ahead, say "the perfect
                is the enemy of the good" one more fucking time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Senior should actually mean senior. The title got so watered down that we had to add more dumb
                titles like "staff engineer" and "principal engineer."
            </li>
            <li>
                I never call myself an engineer, because I'm not one, and neither are you.
            </li>
            <li>
                Programming, the actual act of writing code, is the best part of the job. It should be maximized.
                I don't want to write less code, I want to write more. I want to do less of everything else.
            </li>
            <li>
                You don't have to use it every day in your job, but if you don't know how to read and write
                languages like C and C++ then you have no business calling yourself a developer.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you aren't proficient with things like Linux, using a shell, using SSH, then you have no
                business calling yourself a developer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Desktops offer the best price/performance and always will.

                Apple is such a walled-fucking-garden it wasn't enough to control the computers, they had to
                make their own processor. They are insular and cult-like. Anyone who has a house full of only
                Apple tech is an idiot. "We're an Apple family" is code for "we're a bunch of douchebags."
            </li>
            <li>
                Male developers grow beards and get obsessed with homebrewing and smoking meats because deep down
                they're insecure about the fact that they don't actually create anything of value.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stop being afraid of writing your own linked list, hash table, or queue. If you're too scared
                to write code, you should find a different profession.
            </li>
            <li>
                We spend too much time optimizing the first experiences with a technology so new people can
                "just get up and running" faster. I'm interested in tools that I can use for years and years.
                The beginning part is the wrong part to optimize for.

                NFTs and cryptocurrencies are a bullshit scam. Web 3.0 is meaningless drivel. The metaverse is
                a concept that marketers believe they invented.
            </li>
            <li>
                The web was better before web 2.0. If you have something to say, make your own site/blog or
                shut up.
            </li>
            <li>
                This is a web 1.0 site. There's no comments section. Why? Because I don't care what you think.
                Go fuck yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                Instead of denying the fact that developers don't make the world a better place, learn to accept
                it. Take satisfaction in writing good code and doing your job well, and stop pretending you're
                changing the world.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are not Google and you'll never be Google. Stop doing everything Google does. Fucking think
                for yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                There's no such thing as a "solved problem." Stop using that dumb phrase.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some will accuse me of gatekeeping. Fine. I'll wear that label. But it doesn't change my opinions.
                Go fuck yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some will be saying "I'm a manager and I'd never hire this person!" I'll learn to live with that.
                Also, go fuck yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                I'm always learning, but I have a lot more fun learning old things than learning new things.

                If the Internet or the web took another decade or three to mature, the world would not be any
                worse off.
            </li>
            <li>
                Almost all software of any size is shitty and full of bugs. Little glitches and quirks everywhere
                that should have been fixed but aren't.
            </li>
            <li>
                Everybody's human and everybody creates bugs. The important thing is to find them and fucking fix
                them. If you let user-facing bugs sit in your backlog for years, you are an asshole.
            </li>
            <li>
                Anything worth doing is worth doing now. Don't write TODO comments. Just do it now. Oh, you have
                a deadline? Fuck your deadline.
            </li>
            <li>
                We should all put our own needs and wants ahead of our employer's needs and wants. Taking
                satisfcation in my work is more important to me than productivity, and always will be. If you
                don't like it, go fuck yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                You might think that with all these opinions, I'm an asshole at work, but in actuality I know that
                being a dick to one's colleagues only makes your job harder. I'm pragmatically respectful in the
                workplace. This is where my real thoughts go.
            </li>
            <li>
                Curiosity should be rewarded. There's nothing wrong with being new at something. It's okay to be
                dumb sometimes. It's not okay to be dumb and lazy.
            </li>
            <li>
                There's too much optimism in the tech industry, especially around stuff like AI. It results in
                grandiose but bullshit claims like "self-driving cars will be everywhere by 2023." No, they
                fucking won't. I call this malignant optimism, and those in our industry, of all people, should
                know better.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can't really be proficient in a new tech stack or language after a weekend. This "anybody
                can pick up anything, no problem" shit ignores the effort it takes to gain vast experience
                in an ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your tools and languages should be an extension of your mind. You should cultivate strong
                muscle memory. Mastery is priceless.
            </li>
            <li>
                You should write your code such that you can look back on it in 5 years and think "damn, this
                is well done." If your code isn't in that state, keep working on it. Now.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every piece of code should be able to justify its existence. If you have to add a comment to
                make that justification clear, add it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any decent developer should have an understanding of the underlying hardware. Understand how
                memory works and how CPUs operate in general.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you've never assembled a computer, you are a sack of shit.
            </li>
            <li>
                Teach your kids to use real computers with keyboard and mice. They don't have to grow up to be
                developers, but they should be proficient at computing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Computers are tools for creating, mobile devices are tools for mindless zombie consumption.
            </li>
            <li>
                Branching has its uses, but people go way overboard and end up with a spaghetti-like mess.
                I use branches when they're justified, not as some kind of adherence to best practice.
            </li>
            <li>
                People who spend too much time talking about best practices are not senior developers, even
                if they have "senior" in their title.
            </li>
            <li>
                The reason I'm not crazy about AI is this: computers are useful to me because they are fast
                and accurate. AI is neither of those things. I don't need computers to be my brain. I 
                have one and it works fine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Less code may be better, but less time spent writing code is never better.
            </li>

                Stop being afraid of memory management. Learn to use debuggers and other tools.

            <li>
                Visual programming languages will never take over because they don't solve a real problem. The
                syntax of a programming language is the least challenging part. If you are afraid of syntax,
                find another profession.
            </li>
            <li>
                Something isn't better just because it's new. Conversely, something isn't better just because
                it's old. Things are either shit or they're not. Chronology doesn't really enter into it.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're forced to use a tech stack that you hate, it's okay to slow walk the job in retaliation.
            </li>

                Malicious compliance is magnificent. It should be a tool in everyone's toolbox. If you don't
                know what that is, then look it up, dumbass.
            </li>
            <li>
                The robustness principle sounds good in the near term but it's crap in the long term.
                Force people to fix their stupid broken shit and everything will be more robust in the
                long run.
            </li>
            <li>
                Libraries are always better than frameworks. That's right, I said always. "Oh my god, 
                an absolute! Absolutes are bad," I hear you gasp. If you're about to quote Revenge of
                the Sith, how about you fuck off instead.
            </li>
            <li>
                Go isn't a terrible language. I've seen a lot worse. Go developers are obnoxious cultists.
            </li>
            <li>
                This may surprise you, but I actually don't think JavaScript is a terrible language.
                I've seen a lot worse. The worst parts about JavaScript are the ecosystem and the community.
                It's a case study in why barriers to entry are good.
            </li>
            <li>
                PHP is a terrible language. If you're about to say "it's improved a lot," save your breath. PHP is like
                if you sent a meal back at a restaurant because there was literal shit in it, and then they bring it back out
                saying "we scraped off the shit for you, enjoy!"
            </li>
            <li>
                Management would love to make all developers interchangeable. Why would I help them? What's in it for me?
            </li>
            <li>
                I enjoy working with new developers and with very senior developers. It's intermediate-level developers I can't
                stand.
            </li>
            <li>
                I identify with developers more based upon what they hate rather than what they love. Anyone who shits on NFTs
                is probably someone I can enjoy talking to.
            </li>
            <li>
                That first year of pandemic lockdown was probably one of the best years of my life.
